# OrchardLease — Backend API

Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) REST API for the OrchardLease orchard
rental marketplace. JWT access + refresh-token auth, role-based access
(seller / renter / admin), analytics, moderation and audit logging.

## Quick start

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env          # then edit secrets
npm install
npm run seed                  # optional: sample sellers, renters, orchards
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5000
```

- Swagger docs: `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`
- Health: `http://localhost:5000/health`

### Seeded credentials

## Auth model

- **Access token** (JWT, short-lived) — sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Refresh token** (JWT, long-lived) — stored as an `httpOnly` cookie and as a
  hashed row in the `Session` collection (one per device). Rotated on every
  refresh; reuse detection revokes the session.
- **Admin** — single account from `.env` (`ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`),
  no DB record. Login only.
- Pass the current session id back via the `x-session-id` header so
  "log out other devices" / change-password can keep the current device alive.

## Security

Helmet, CORS allowlist, `express-mongo-sanitize`, `hpp`, custom XSS body
sanitizer, bcrypt hashing, account lockout after repeated failed logins,
global + auth-specific rate limiting, Zod request validation, central error
handler with leak-safe production output.

## Key endpoints (prefix `/api/v1`)

| Area     | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Auth     | `POST /auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/admin/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/sessions` |
| Users    | `GET/PATCH /users/me`, `POST /users/me/avatar`, `GET /users/me/activity` |
| Orchards | `GET /orchards` (search/filter/sort/paginate), `GET /orchards/:slug`, `POST /orchards`, `/orchards/:id/publish` |
| Bookings | `POST /bookings`, `/bookings/:id/approve|reject|cancel|complete` |
| Reviews  | `POST /reviews`, `GET /orchards/:orchardId/reviews` |
| Wishlist | `GET /wishlist`, `/wishlist/:orchardId/toggle`, `/wishlist/compare` |
| Follow   | `POST /follow/:sellerId`, `DELETE /follow/:sellerId`, `GET /following`, `GET /followers/:sellerId`, `GET /following/orchards` |
| Weather  | `GET /weather/:orchardId` (retrieve normalized current + 7-day forecast) |
| Seller   | `GET /seller/overview|revenue|performance`, `/seller/export/bookings` |
| Admin    | `GET /admin/dashboard|analytics`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/orchards/queue`, `/admin/audit-logs`, `/admin/settings` |
| Meta     | `GET /meta/filters`, `/meta/featured`, `/meta/settings` |

## Favorite Seller & Follow System

Supports renter-to-seller social following and real-time listing notifications:
- **Follow Rules**: Only renters can follow sellers. Sellers cannot follow other users or self-follow.
- **Model**: `Follow` schema with compound unique index on `{ follower, seller }`.
- **Notifications**: Automatic in-app notification dispatch to seller followers whenever a followed seller publishes a new orchard or updates listing details.
- **Dashboard**: Renter Following page (`/following`) lists followed sellers, follower count, total orchards, latest listing quick view, and profile links.

## Weather Insights

A full weather integration supporting:
- **Provider**: Open-Meteo API is configured as the default weather provider. Provider logic is abstract, allowing alternative providers to be swapped in.
- **Geocoding Fallback**: If an orchard listing lacks exact coordinates (`latitude`/`longitude`), the backend automatically resolves coordinates from the orchard's address text (`district, state, country`) using Open-Meteo Geocoding Search API.
- **Caching**: Standard in-memory caching utility stores weather queries (`weather:{lat}:{lon}`) for **30 minutes (TTL)**. Coordinates are rounded to 4 decimal places (approx. 11 meters precision) to normalize cache hits and prevent provider spamming.
- **Errors**: Gracefully handles network failures, timeouts, unavailable providers, or missing coordinates/addresses.

## Placeholders to wire later
- **Cloudinary** — `services/upload.service.js` (returns placeholder URLs today).
- **Email** — `services/email.service.js` (logs to console today).

## Orchard Availability Calendar

A complete availability and date management system for renters and sellers:
- **Available Dates**: View real-time active available windows for orchard leasing.
- **Booked Dates**: Automatically reflects active requested (`REQUESTED`) and confirmed (`APPROVED`) renter bookings.
- **Seller Blocked Dates**: Enables sellers to block custom date ranges for `Maintenance`, `Harvest`, `Personal`, or `System` reasons.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Overlap validation prevents overlapping blocked ranges, double bookings, or booking on blocked dates.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/orchards/:id/availability` — Retrieve availability grid, booked dates, blocked dates, maintenance and harvest periods (Public).
  - `POST /api/v1/orchards/:id/block-dates` — Create a blocked date range (Seller/Admin).
  - `PUT /api/v1/orchards/:id/block-dates/:blockId` — Update a blocked date range (Seller/Admin).
  - `DELETE /api/v1/orchards/:id/block-dates/:blockId` — Remove a blocked date range (Seller/Admin).

## Testing
Architecture is test-ready (`supertest` + `jest` installed). Add specs under
`src/**/__tests__`; `NODE_ENV=test` disables rate limiting and file logging.
